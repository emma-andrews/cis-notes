## Reference Monitor
- **purpose** - ensures enforcement of security goals
	- *[[Mandatory Protection|mandatory protection state]]* defines goals
	- reference monitor ensures *[[Enforcement|enforcement]]*
- every components that you **depend** on to enforce your security goals must be enforced by a **reference monitor**
- **components**
	- reference monitor interfaces
		- e.g. [[SELinux|Linux Security Modules]]
	- authorization module
		- e.g. [[SELinux|SELinux]]
	- policy store
		- e.g. policy binary
### Guarantees
- ***complete mediation, tamperproof, and verifiable***
- **complete mediation** - reference validation mechanism must always be invoked
	- every security-sensitive operation must be *mediated*
		- *security-sensitive operation* - an operation that enables a subject of one label to access an object that may be a different label
	- **validating**
		- every security-sensitive operation must be identified
		- then check for *dominance* of mediation
	- **main questions**
		- does interface mediate correctly?
		- on all resources?
		- verifiably?
- **tamperproof** - reference validation mechanism must be secure against modification
	- prevent modification by untrusted entities
		- interface, mechanism, and policy of a reference monitor
		- code and policy that can affect reference monitor
	- detecting
		- *transitive closure* of operations
		- often some untrusted operations are present, posing a challenge
	- **main questions**
		- is reference monitor protected?
		- is system [[Enforcement|TCB]] protected?
- **verifiable** - reference validation mechanism must be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which must be assured
	- test and analyze
		- reference validation mechanism
		- tamperproof dependencies
		- security goals the system enforces
	- determining the correctness of the code and policy
		- how do we define correctness for each?
	- **main questions**
		- is TCB code base correct?
		- does the protection system enforce the system's security goals
### Evaluation
- evaluation based on the **main questions**
	- mediation - does interface mediate correctly?
	- mediation - on all resources?
	- mediation - verifiably?
	- tamperproof - is reference monitor protected?
	- tamperproof - is system TCB protected?
	- verifiable - is TCB code base correct?
	- verifiable - does the protection system enforce the system's security goals?
### Multiple Reference Monitors
- original reference monitor concept approached designed with a centralized reference validation mechanism n mind
- what happens if we have several of these mechanisms grouped together?
	- how to reason their composability?
