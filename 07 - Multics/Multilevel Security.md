## Overview
- **secrecy** for [[Multics|multics]]
- **multilevel security system** - tags all objects and subjects with security tags
	- classifies them in terms of sensitivity and access level
- formulate access policy based on these levels
- can add other dimensions called **categories** that horizontally partition the rights space
	- similar to [[General Security Concepts|roles]]
## Example - Department of Defense Policy
- **lattice model** - uses multilevel security to define policy
- levels
	- unclassified < confidential < secret < top secret
- **categories** represented as an *unbounded set*
	- nuclear, intelligence, cryptography
- levels are also used for physical documents
- **confidential** - unauthorized disclosure could reasonably result in damage to national security
- **secret** - unauthorized disclosure could reasonably result in serious damage to national security
- **top secret** - unauthorized disclosure could reasonably result in exceptionally grave famage to national security
- **sensitive compartmented information (SCI)** - special category that provides exceptionally sensitive access
	- requires numerous security clearance briefs during employment and a lifetime binding NDA
- all subjects are assigned **clearance levels** and **compartments**
- all objects are assigned an **access class**
- access is allowed if
	- subject's clearance level is greater than or equal to the object's sensitivity level
	- subject's categories are a subset of the object's categories
		- *read-down property
- **formal definitions**
	- *dominance relationship* - ability to access a resource because of greater level of rights
		- if $A$ can access $C$ then it dominates
		- $(A,C)dom(A',C')<=>A'\geq A \cap C' \subseteq C$
- **Hasse diagram** - represents *security lattices*
	- represents a finite poset as a directed graph of its transitive reduction
		- minimum representation of edges
- **Bell-LaPadula (BLP) Model** - confidentiality multilevel security model that enforces
	- *simple security property* - a subject at a specific classification level cannot read data at a higher classification level
		- **no read up**
	- *star/confinement property* - states that a subject at a specific classification level cannot write data at a lower classification level
		- **no write down**
## Secrecy
- prevent **leakage**
	- e.g. top-secret process should not have a Trojan horse
	- *trojan horse* - program that performs a useful function and a malicious function
	- with standard protection mechanisms, trojan horse can leak top-secret data to a secret process
	- with mls, trojan horse *cannot*
## As Mandatory Protection System
- is mls a [[Mandatory Protection|mps]]?
- **protection state**
	- fixed labels
	- defined and fixed information flows
- **labeling state**
	- subjects login at a label
	- objects are labeled at creation according to mls rules
- **transition state**
	- no transitions of secrecy
		- *covert channels*
