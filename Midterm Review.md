- trusted vs trustworthy
- compromise of any components is a violation of sys sec
- ref monitor!!! class can like never answer ref monitor questions so he keeps hinting at it being on exam
- access matrix
- discretionary vs mandatory access control
	- mandatory - can only be changed by a trusted admin, think of terms in labels instead of subjects + objects
		- labels assigned by security matrix
		- immutable access matrix
			- benefit - can reason about future state of sys
				- what safety problem is all abt - will i be in a safe state in the future
- access control lists
	- in both windows + linux
- file squatting, tmp attacks
- access races
- buffer overflows - can happen in stack or heap
	- stackguard, why it is hard to design heapguard
	- why these defenses arent effective vs rop
	- rop is based on returns in libraries
		- control flow integrity as way of dealing with rop
- confinement - introduced covert channels
	- storage + timing channels
- multics
	- access calls with rings, procedures in segments
	- mls at software level
	- tradeoff usability and performance with security
		- led to master mode vuln
- rbac - assign roles to users
- lsm - try to get security guarantees from multics in linux
	- policy determines what to enforce
	- selinux combo of kernel and user level processes and policies
- mls - blp conf model
	- not just abt levels, but also categories
	- should know reading and writing, what goes up and down
	- integrity of blp
- noninterference - should not know when high level op is doing anything
- clark wilson integrity - most systems do not need lattice models since they are not flexible enough for practical use
	- ensure high integrity components only communicate with other high integrity components
- "good to know for exam"
	- reasonable idea of all concepts
	- questions today about what makes sys integrity not good for runtime integrity
	- apply knowledge of concepts and assess pros and cons of approaches
	- how concepts work together
	- ðŸ˜¢
