## Overview
- review - [[Reference Monitor Concept|reference monitor components]]
	- interface
		- **mediation** - where to make access control decisions
		- **authorization** - which access control decisions to make
		- [[Linux Security Modules|lsm]] interface
	- **decision function** - compute decision based on request and policy
		- e.g. selinux, lids, dte, etc
	- **policy** - need a way to represent access control policy
	- main mechanism issue - find a mechanism to enable *verification* that policy achieves function and meets security guarantees
- **[[Access Control|access control]]** - determine whether a principal can perform a *requested operation*
	- *principal* - user, process, etc
	- *operation* - read, write, etc
	- *object* - file, tuple, etc
	- Lampson defined the access matrix and its two interpretations, ACLs and capabilities
- **access control policy** - specification for an *access decision function*
	- aims to achieve
		- *availability* - permit the principal's function
		- *integrity and confidentiality* - ensure security properties are met
			- limit to **[[SELinux|least privilege]]**
			- prevent system integrity
			- prevent [[Confinement|unauthorized leakage]]
			- aka **constraints**
		- *simplicity* - enable administration of a changeable system
### "Simple" Example
- prof alice manages access to course objects
	- assign access to individual - principal Bob
	- assign access to aggregate - course-students
	- associate access to relation - students(course)
	- assign students to project groups - student(course, project, group)
- prof alice wants certain guarantees
	- students cannot modify objects written by prof alice
	- students cannot read/modify objects of other groups
- prof alice must be able to maintain access policy
	- ensure that individual rights do not violate guarantees
	- *however*, exceptions are possible
		- students may distribute their results from previous assignments for an exam
### Difficulty of Access Control
- access control requirements are **domain-specific**
	- generic approached *over-generalize*
- access control requirements can change, even for mac policies
- **safety problem** - can only know what is leaked *right now*
	- determine if an unauthorized permission is leaked given:
		- an initial set of permissions
		- an access control system, mainly administrative operations
	- for a traditional approach, the safety problem is *undecidable*
		- access matrix model with multi-operational commands
		- main culprit is *creating* object/subject with own rights
		- prove reduction of a Turing machine to the multi-operational access matrix system
	- **result**
		- *safe*, but limited models
			- take-grant, schematic protection model, typed access matrix model
		- further support for models in which the constraints are *implicit* in the model
			- e.g. lattice models
		- check *safety* on each policy change - constraint approach of [[Role Based Access Control|rbac]]
- access if **fail-safe**, but constraints are not
	- constraints must restrict all future states
- comparison to other computer science problems
	- **processor design** - hard but you can construct one, fixed, testable design
	- **network protocol design**
		- *tcp* has a small number of control parameters necessary to manage all reasonable options within a layered architecture
		- constraints like ddos are ad hoc
	- **operating systems** - lots of heuristic algorithms to computationally hard problems, but very little end user configuration of policy
		- policy configuration done by os distributors
