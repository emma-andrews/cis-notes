#cis/security_kernels/scomp 
## Details
- honeywell level 6 minicomputer enhanced with processor instructions
	- bus connected units for cpus, i/o controllers, and memory
	- hardware-based secure processor module (spm)
- special-purpose **kernel software**
- **stop** - scomp trusted operating system
- **skip** - scomp kernel interface package
- **scomp system architecture**
	- hardware
	- **tcb**
		- stop - [[Security Kernels|security kernel]] - ring 0 trusted
		- stop - trusted software - ring 1 trusted
		- skip - trusted functions - ring 2 trusted
	- applications
		- skip - libraries - ring 3 untrusted
## vs Multics
- like [[Multics|multics]]
	- **access control** via *segments*
		- memory segments and i/o segments
		- files defined at a higher level
	- **security goals**
		- *secrecy* - implemented with [[Multilevel Security|mls]]
		- *integrity* - [[Protection Rings|ring brackets]]
- unlike multics
	- **mediation** on segments
		- all access control and protection rings implemented in hardware (mmu)
	- **formal verification**
		- verify that the formal model *enforces* mls policy
		- trusted software outside the kernel verified using a *procedural specification*
		- separate the kernel from *system api functions* - different protection rings used
## Hardware
- **security protection module (spm)** - mediates all accesses to i/o controllers and memory by mediating the i/o bus
	- translates virtual addresses to physical segment addresses for authorization
	- interspersed among system elements
		- mediation for cpu references to memory, cpu references to i/o, i/o device references to memory
- i/o device drivers can run in user-space
	- does not work in a normal os, but does in scomp
		- does not work in modern os because of kernel checks
	- works because the kernel builds to i/o descriptor and the hardware authorizes the i/o operation
	- performance and security advantages
		- once access is mediated, the user process may interact with the devices directly, removing the need for kernel processing and context switches
		- drivers are source for many kernel errors, so removing them from tcb will improve software correctness
		- extensibility not hindered as new i/o devices can be added without modifying the kernel or spm
## STOP
- os including kernel
- security kernel lives in ring 0
	- provides memory management, process scheduling, interrupt management, auditing, and reference monitoring functions
	- 10k lines of Pascal
	- ring transitions controlled by 38 gates (apis)
- **trusted software** - officially part of stop, but runs outside of ring 0
	- software is trusted with *system security goals*
		- e.g. process loader, database editor
	- system policy management and use (auth services) also considered trusted software
		- user services - interface to scomp for user
		- trusted operation services - provide functions that enable sys admins to manage the system
		- trusted maintenance functions - enable sys admins to modify system data
		- trusted services for skip kernel interface
	- 23 processes, 11k lines of c
		- all interactions use a trusted path
		- trusted path in modern os is secure attention sequence
## SKIP
- like a **system call interface** for *user processes*
	- trusted operations on user-level objects
	- still trusted to not violate mls requirements
- skip library runs in user space, ring 3
- hierarchical file system
	- implemented outside of kernel, all file system operations are invoked by skip gate to ring 2
	- manipulate objects at level of segment
	- accessible through skip
	- all non-kernel i/o is *unprivileged*
## Evaluation
- **applications of scomp**
	- can be used by mls-trusted applications
	- mail guard
		- makes sure that secrets are not leaked in communications to less secret subjects
		- obtains labeled communications
		- has ad-hoc filters to prevent leakages
	- scomp ideal platform because it is assured to enforce the mls requirements and execute the application without allowing malicious software to take control of its execution
- **complete mediation**
	- *correct?*
		- all mediation is performed in hardware, so always performed on the correct system resource
	- *comprehensive?*
		- at the segment level
		- all security-sensitive accesses mediated by hardware since all system resources are segments
		- file system must be trusted to prevent unauthorized access to one process's file data by another process
	- *verified?*
		- hardware verification justifies complete mediation
- **tamperproof**
	- *protection from modification?*
		- uses protection rings
	- *protect tcb?*
		- [[Enforcement|tcb]] runs in rings 0, 1, 2
- **verifiable**
	- *code?*
		- performed verification on implementation with semi-automated methods
			- formal top level specification for the kernel developed in the formal specification langauge SPECIAL
			- formal top-level specification of the trusted software developed in gypsy
			- formally describe the tcb in terms of exceptions, messages, effects
		- this work led to standardized criteria and approaches for software assurance
	- *policy?*
		- mls is the security goal and is formally specified by blp
		- integrity is more difficult, there is no formal analysis framework
- scomp not used because of performance, practical utility, and maintenance complexity
